# Beginners Project 2: Treasure Hunt/Quiz

The user is randomly generated into one of two scenarios (you should have a screen that states that they are being generated into one of two scenarios):

One, they enter a forest and have to play a series of games to survive.
Two, there is a quiz based on various coding concepts.

*Game elements are not compulsory (eg. loading screen, additional text) but would be a nice touch for your task! There will be prizes for the best presentation and the best creativity :)

## Forest treasure hunt
First a wild monkey appears and the player cannot pass until five fruits have been guessed!
User inputs five fruits, guessing whatever fruits have been predetermined by you (eg. banana, apple, strawberry, blueberry, orange)
Program lets them pass if all correct
If at least one is incorrect, state which fruits are correct and repeat until all five have been guessed
(it does not matter what order the fruits are guessed in for the user to pass)

Secondly, there is a hungry tiger, and the only way out is the nearest that needs you to cross a river. The user is to input their height; if they are too short they will drown and if they are too tall they are too easily spotted and will be hunted down.
160cm or less = you drown
Between 160 and 180 = live
Over 180 = the tiger spots you too easily and you die.

Lastly, there is a door that requires a password to unlock- it is a series of four numbers.
User inputs 4 numbers
They have 10 chances to guess the password
Only the number of correct numbers after each guess can be given as a hint
Program outputs a success message if guessed correctly

## Python quiz
Create a quiz that asks 6 multichoice questions on Python.
Ending message should include:
Number of questions answered correctly
Number of questions answered incorrectly
Percentage
Have a different ending message for each score out of 6 (eg. ‘congrats’ if they get 6/6, or ‘you’re bad’ if they get 0/6)

Once each game is finished, ask the user if they would like to try the other game. If yes, cue the other game. If not, finish with an ending message.

Good luck!
